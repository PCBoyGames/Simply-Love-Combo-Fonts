# Contributions
Upon a contributed pull request, I (PCBoyGames) will verify that the font works as intended for both the combo and measure counters.
## Corrections
For .ini file or file name corrections, I will do it myself. If it is vertically misaligned, I will correct it. If the kerning looks a bit off, I will correct it. If the name(s) of the image and/or configuration file do not match the folder, I will correct it.

Image and LUA related components I will not correct. 

If the font is too big or too small, and I do not have a working copy of the font or cannot install it for free, I will send it back to you with this comment:

>Thank you for your contribution to the Simply Love combo font repository. I would have liked to put your combo font in the list. However, I am either not able to recreate or manipulate the image in such a way it works perfectly with other combo fonts I have made and those in Simply Love by default. If the image uses a *(bigger/smaller)* font size than you provided, I will add it to the list. Should you see the need fit for such, please fix this and let me know, and I will reconsider.

If the font requires any LUA manipulation in a file apart from those in the font folder, I will send it back to you with this comment:

However, I do not store LUA file replacements in these folders in such a way it works perfectly with other combo fonts I have made and nearly all of those in Simply Love by default. If the effect can be remade in the image and configuration file, I will add it to the list. Should you see the need fit for such, please fix this and let me know, and I will reconsider.

If the font uses the number map instead of the main or does not include a certain character or character set, such as ()/ not being seen in it, I will send it back to you with this comment:

However, your font has only *included*, and would not work with the measure counter in such a way it works perfectly with other combo fonts I have made and those in Simply Love by default. I understand some fonts do not have *set*, but if yours does, send me the main map, which includes *set*, I will add it to the list. Should you see the need fit for such, please fix this and let me know, and I will reconsider.
