# Contributions
Upon a contributed pull request, I (PCBoyGames) will verify that the font works as intended for both the combo and measure counters.
## Corrections
If it is vertically misaligned, I will correct it. If the name(s) of the image and/or configuration file do not match the folder, I will correct it.

However, if the font is too big or too small, and I do not have a working copy of the font or cannot install it for free, I will send it back to you with this comment:

>Thank you for your contribution to the Simply Love combo font repository. I would have liked to put your combo font in the list. However, I am either not able to recreate or manipulate the image in such a way it works perfectly with other combo fonts I have made and those in Simply Love by default. If the image uses a *(bigger/smaller)* font size than you provided, I will add it to the list. Should you see the need fit for such, please fix this and let me know, and I will reconsider.

If the font requires any LUA manipulation in a file apart from those in the font foler, I will send it back to you with this comment:

>Thank you for your contribution to the Simply Love combo font repository. I would have liked to put your combo font in the list. However, I do not store LUA file replacements in these folders in such a way it works perfectly with other combo fonts I have made and nearly all of those in Simply Love by default. If the effect can be remade in the image and configuration file, I will add it to the list. Should you see the need fit for such, please fix this and let me know, and I will reconsider.

If the font uses the number map instead of the main or does not include ()/ in it, I will send it back to you with this comment:

>Thank you for your contribution to the Simply Love combo font repository. I would have liked to put your combo font in the list. However, your font has only 1234567890, and would not work with the measure counter in such a way it works perfectly with other combo fonts I have made and those in Simply Love by default. If you use the main map instead, which includes ()/ whereas the numbers map does not, I will add it to the list. Should you see the need fit for such, please fix this and let me know, and I will reconsider.
