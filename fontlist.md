# Font List

This list will update as more combo fonts are created.

The names in parentheses state the alias of the user who implemented it as a Simply Love combo font. If you send a pull without changing this part of the README, I will add it here with your GitHub alias, and if it is not the same as your Stepmania/ITG player/themer/modder/memer/whatever you do with the game alias, I will replace this after you ask me to. If you troll this README, I will revert it, but add the fonts to the list as needed if they are fit to add.
